# Chiropter

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a very simple text editor, i did it for the sake of learning more about PyQt. I put some basic features that every editor have, like New/Open/Save files and handling edit events (Copy, Paste, Cut, etc).

I'll try after a while to refactor the code and add more styles/languages, and maybe transform it into a Markdown editor, with Spellcheck/Highlighted words.
