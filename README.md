# Chiropter

This is a very simple text editor, i did it for the sake of learning more about PyQt. I put some basic features that every editor have, like New/Open/Save files and handling edit events (Copy, Paste, Cut, etc).

I'll try after a while to refactor the code and add more styles/languages, and maybe transform it into a Markdown editor, with Spellcheck/Highlighted words.

Install it:

You'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and PyQt5 installed:
```
pip install PyQt5
```
Then:
```
git clone "https://github.com/oOperaho/Chiropter"
cd [folder-you-downloaded]
python Chiropterus.py
```
